The solution here is slightly different. The key point to note is that uppercase letters are used in the code above, indicating something that should not be used.

We can bypass it using a ? symbol, which prevents triggering an error. XSS is not present in this case.

Solution Code= <?cript/?alert(1)</?cript>
